## Competition Brief

Welcome to the Crypto Currency Price Prediction Challenge!

In the ever-evolving world of digital finance, cryptocurrencies have become much more than just an investment opportunity â€“ they're revolutionizing the way we think about and engage in transactions online. After a rollercoaster year in 2022, marked by market downturns in response to interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve, it's been nothing short of thrilling to see cryptos bounce back with vigor at the start of 2023, even close to hitting record highs without any easing of federal funds rates.

Amidst this exciting landscape, bitgrit â€“ a leading company in data science competitions and an emerging force in Web3 technology â€“ is thrilled to announce the upcoming release of its own token, BGR. This new token is set to enrich experiences on our platform, making our community and competitions even more engaging. Now is the best time to celebrate our new endeavor with a brand-new challenge that's all about forecasting the future of the crypto price. Whether you're a seasoned trader or simply crypto-curious, we're inviting you to put your prediction prowess to the test.

"Will the cryptocurrency (ticker is undisclosed) rise or fall within a two-week window?" That's for you to decide, using a rich tapestry of information ranging from market trends to social media indicators. We believe that diversity fuels innovation, so no matter where you come from or what your background is, if you've got a knack for numbers and a passion for crypto, join a warm community of like-minded enthusiasts and excel in a professional yet congenial competition atmosphere.
